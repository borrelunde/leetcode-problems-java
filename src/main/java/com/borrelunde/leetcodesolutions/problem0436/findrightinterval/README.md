# 436. Find Right Interval

Difficulty: `Medium`  
Topics: `Array`, `Binary Search`, `Sorting`

You are given an array of `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` and each `start_i` is **unique**.

The **right interval** for an interval `i` is an interval `j` such that `start_j >= end_i` and `start_j` is
**minimized**. Note that `i` may equal `j`.

Return *an array of **right interval** indices for each interval `i`*. If no **right interval** exists for interval `i`,
then put `-1` at index `i`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: intervals = [[1,2]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: intervals = [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]
Output: [-1,0,1]
Explanation: There is no right interval for [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start_0 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end_1 = 3.
The right interval for [1,2] is [2,3] since start_1 = 2 is the smallest start that is >= end_2 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: [-1,2,-1]
Explanation: There is no right interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start_2 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end_1 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-10^6 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^6`
- The start point of each interval is **unique**.
